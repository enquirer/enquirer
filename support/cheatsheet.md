- [Elements](#elements) - Elements combine styles, unicode symbols, and text for the various parts of a prompt.

## Elements

An element is a functions that is responsible for combining the styles, text and unicode symbols to display for a specific part of prompt, based on prompt's [state](#state) and [status](#status).

prefix
message
separator
indicator


## Transforms

objects that consist of a `render` function and a `result` function. based on the state and status of the prompt.

## Terminology

Whenever possible, we attempted to use familiar concepts and terminology from HTML/CSS to describe prompt behavior and attributes.

| **term** | **description** |
| --- | --- |
| `focused` | The currently targeted choice in a _visible_ list of choices. Similar in concept to focus in HTML and CSS. |
| `pointer` | Marks the choice that currently has focus. The `‚ùØ` symbol is often used for this, but the pointer is not always visible, as with the `autocomplete` prompt. |
| `indicator` | Designates whether or not a choice is checked/enabled.  |
| `index` | The zero-based position of the pointer in the visible list of choices.  |
| `cursor` | The zero-based position of the cursor relative to user input. |
| `selected` | The position of the currently choice. |
| `enabled` | The position of the currently choice. |
| `active` | The position of the currently choice. |
| `element` | Elements are the various parts of a prompt. An element may consist of styles, text and unicode symbols. |

## Styles

Styles are semantically-named functions that may be used for adding color (via ANSI style codes) to the various elements of a prompt.

### Default palette

| `complement`    | Complement of `styles.primary` | Not used. |
| `answered`      | `styles.primary`               | Used in several prompts to style user input after submitted. |
| `cancelled`     | `styles.danger`                | Used to style the prompt prefix when the prompt is cancelled. |
| `completing`    | `styles.default`               | Not used. |

### Applying styles

If you are a prompt author, styles may be accessed using `prompt.styles` (or `this.styles` inside a prompt instance), where each "style" is a function that wraps the returned string in ANSI codes.

## Events

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `state`  | A clone of the `prompt.state` object is emitted for each keypress. |
| `alert`  | Emitted when `prompt.alert()` is called. This is useful for detecting invalid keypresses when output is not visible in the terminal (as in unit tests). |
| `submit` | Emitted with the answer `value` when submitted by the user. |
| `cancel` | Emitted when the prompt is terminated by the user or an error is thrown. |
| `close`  | Emitted when the readline interface is closed and the input stream is paused. |
| `run`    | Emitted when the prompt has been initialized. |
