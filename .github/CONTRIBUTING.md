## Issues

### Before creating an issue

Please try to determine if the issue is caused by an underlying library, and if so, create the issue there. Sometimes this is difficult to know. We only ask that you attempt to give a reasonable attempt to find out. Oftentimes the readme will have advice about where to go to create issues.

Try to follow these guidelines

- **Investigate the issue**:
- **Check the readme** - oftentimes you will find notes about creating issues, and where to go depending on the type of issue.
- Create the issue in the appropriate repository.

### Creating an issue

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating an issue. Give us the information we need to successfully answer your question or address your issue by answering the following in your issue:

- **version**: please note the version of enquirer are you using
- **extensions, plugins, helpers, etc** (if applicable): please list any extensions you're using
- **error messages**: please paste any error messages into the issue, or a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)

## Above and beyond

Here are some tips for creating idiomatic issues. Taking just a little bit extra time will make your issue easier to read, easier to resolve, more likely to be found by others who have the same or similar issue in the future.

- read the [Guide to Idiomatic Contributing](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/idiomatic-contributing)
- take some time to learn basic markdown. This [markdown cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/5854601) is super helpful, as is the GitHub guide to [basic markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
- Learn about [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). And if you want to really go above and beyond, read [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- use backticks to wrap code. This ensures that code will retain its format, making it much more readable to others
- use syntax highlighting by adding the correct language name after the first "code fence"
